     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p><em>Raspberry sorbet is the refreshing, fruity dessert of your dreams! Made with just 3 simple 
         ingredients, homemade raspberry sorbet is low in calories, gluten-free, and dairy-free!</em></p>
    <p>As much as I love ice cream (who doesn’t?!), when I want to whip up something fruity, cool, and sweet,
        I’m a big fan of making homemade sorbet.

        When it comes to sweet treats, it doesn’t get healthier or 
        simpler than a sorbet. All you really need is a fresh fruit 
        of your choosing. You can choose to kick it up a bit with 
        raw honey for added sweetness or lemon juice for a little 
        pop of flavor. I always try to make all my desserts as 
        healthy as possible and use raw honey instead of sugar.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Raspberries</li>
        <li>Raw honey</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Warm water</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to do it</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay out the fresh raspberries over a rimmed baking sheet lined with
             parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Freeze the raspberries until completely solid, which should take at 
            least 2-3 hours, but I usually just leave them in the freezer overnight.</li>
        <li>Place the frozen raspberries into the bowl of a food processor or heavy
             duty blender, along with a little raw honey, and freshly squeezed lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>You may need to add a little warm water and press down with a spatula to help the 
            process along.</li>
        <li>Eat immediately for a softer texture, or transfer into a freezer-safe container
             and freeze for 3-4 hours or until firm.</li>
    </ol>
