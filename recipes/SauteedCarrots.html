     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p><em>RHere are the best sauteed carrots you’ll ever have! The perfect easy side dish, they’re made with just
          3 ingredients and done in 10 minutes.</em></p>
    <p>Perhaps sauteed carrots doesn’t sound like it could be mind blowing. But these really are the perfect
         sauteed carrots! Alex made these for me the other day, and I could not believe the flavor. “What 
         is IN these?” I kept asking. Well, turns out they’re very simple. These are the most tender,
         buttery, savory, coins, with a hint of herbaceous fresh thyme and chives. They taste like 
         the best carrots you’ve ever had: but they only have 3 ingredients and take 10 minutes. </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>How to do it</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cover and cook for 4 minutes: no stirring! </li>
        <li>Uncover and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring.
             Now you can actually saute! Saute comes from 
             the French word “to jump,” so you keep the 
             food moving as much as possible. Add the salt 
             and herbs, and you’re done! </li>
    </ol>
