     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p><em>What’s better than having a sweet breakfast with a delicious homemade jam and a large cup of tea, on a lazy Sunday morning?
          These slices of sweet eggy bread are perfect for the most important meal of the day, and if you ask Romanians, many of them
           will probably tell you that it’s the breakfast of their childhood.</em></p>
    <p>I can’t say that I ate these Romanian eggy breakfast bread slices called frig?nele a lot when I was a little girl, but I 
        remember that my best friend’s grandma used to make these fried bread slices all the time for her. I don’t think that
         she made them sweet though; she skipped adding sugar and served them with Romanian telemea cheese.</p>
